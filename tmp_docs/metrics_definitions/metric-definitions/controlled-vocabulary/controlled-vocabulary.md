# Controlled vocabulary

This section lists several example metrics in an attempt to capture which fields would be required to accurately describe how each metric has been calculated. When defining each metric, we attempt to align to the following general template:

- Id (mandatory): Metric identifier
- Description (mandatory): Metric description.
- Implementation details (mandatory): Tool and version used to calculate the metric & insights into the metric implementation, where possible.
- Functionally equivalent implementations (optional): A description of what constitute a valid alternative implementation producing values within an acceptable range of variation when compared to value(s) reported by the reference implementation when computing the metric i.e Validated equivalent implementations. We welcome the inclusion of candidate equivalent implementations
