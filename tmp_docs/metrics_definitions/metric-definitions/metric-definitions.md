# Metric definitions

In this document, the QC of WGS workgroup intends to identify a set of key QC metrics and spell out their detailed definitions. Whilst doing so, we expect to encounter recurrent information fields that apply to many metrics. Those can then be used as the basis for standardised guidelines for reporting QC metrics.
