# General notes

In terms of scope, the workgroup has agreed to focus on QC of germline WGS first. While all of the workgroup participants are working with short-read data at the moment, we wish to make the definitions general enough to be applicable to other technologies as well. The workgroup also acknowledges that there are multiple stages in the analysis pipeline at which one may want to perform QC (e.g. post-FASTQ generation, post-alignment, post-variant calling). For the first iteration of the guidelines, the workgroup has agreed to focus on metrics that can be obtained from a BAM/CRAM file. Thus, metrics such as contamination or variant counts remain out of scope at the moment.
