# Benchmarking Resources

Our **Benchmarking Sample Manifest** includes predefined input files (such as CRAM/BAM and VCF) along with corresponding expected outputs in JSON format, generated by the reference QC tool.

We execute our benchmarking pipelines on publicly available WGS data specifically, Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) samples from the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 Reanalysis, accessible through the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/ilmn-dragen-1kgp/).

The **1000 Genomes** dataset generated by Illumina DRAGEN Germline is widely adopted across the genomics community, including in major population-scale efforts such as the **UK Biobank** and the **All of Us Research Program**. To promote diversity and representation, we curated a subset of [100 samples](https://github.com/ga4gh/quality-control-wgs/blob/main/benchmark_resources/n.100-1kg-sample-info-igsr.csv) from this dataset, ensuring balanced coverage across multiple populations and both genders.
