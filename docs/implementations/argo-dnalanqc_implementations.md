# WGS Quality Control - Alternative Implementions

[icgc-argo-workflows/dnaalnqc](https://github.com/icgc-argo-workflows/dnaalnqc) is a reproducible bioinformatics workflow that can be used to obtain QC metrics from tumour/normal paired, tumour-only, normal-only WGS/WXS/Targeted-Seq aligned reads. It has been created to support quality control efforts within ICGC-ARGO project. The aggregated QC metrics are formed to align with the GA4GH [WGS Quality Control Standards](https://www.ga4gh.org/product/wgs-quality-control-standards/)
.
