# WGS Quality Control - Reference Implemention

[NPM-sample-qc](https://github.com/c-BIG/NPM-sample-qc) is a Nextflow workflow to obtain QC metrics from single-sample WGS results. It has been created to support QC efforts within the National Precision Medicine programme in Singapore (NPM). In collaboration with GA4GH , the [WGS Quality Control Standards](https://www.ga4gh.org/product/wgs-quality-control-standards/) was formed with this workflow as first reference implementation of the standards.
