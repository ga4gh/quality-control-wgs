# Benchmarking Resources

The benchmarking resources provided here are designed to ensure consistency, reliability, and transparency in the evaluation of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Quality Control (QC) tools.

These resources serve multiple key purposes:

- They act as a standardized set of "unit tests" for validating reference implementation tools—verifying correct input handling, output formatting, and generation of functionally equivalent QC metrics.

- They support the evaluation of implementation quality and performance by benchmarking computational efficiency, including runtime and memory usage.

Our **Benchmarking Sample Manifest** includes predefined input files (such as CRAM/BAM and VCF) along with corresponding expected outputs in JSON format, generated by the reference QC tool.

We execute our benchmarking pipelines on publicly available WGS data—specifically, Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) samples from the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 Reanalysis, accessible through the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/ilmn-dragen-1kgp/).

The **1000 Genomes** dataset generated by Illumina DRAGEN Germline is widely adopted across the genomics community, including in major population-scale efforts such as the **UK Biobank** and the **All of Us Research Program**. To promote diversity and representation, we curated a subset of [100 samples](https://github.com/ga4gh/quality-control-wgs/blob/main/benchmark_resources/n.100-1kg-sample-info-igsr.csv) from this dataset, ensuring balanced coverage across multiple populations and both genders.

To assist with result interpretation, we also provide an interactive [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ga4gh/quality-control-wgs/blob/main/benchmark_resources/stats/Metrics_distribution.ipynb) that visualizes metric distributions across these samples. This enables users to explore how QC metrics vary at the population level and supports comparative analysis.
