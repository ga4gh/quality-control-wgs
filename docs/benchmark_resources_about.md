# Benchmarking Resources

The benchmarking resources provided here are designed to ensure consistency, reliability, and transparency in the evaluation of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Quality Control (QC) tools.

These resources serve multiple key purposes:

- They act as a standardized set of "unit tests" for validating reference implementation toolsâ€”verifying correct input handling, output formatting, and generation of functionally equivalent QC metrics.

- They support the evaluation of implementation quality and performance by benchmarking computational efficiency, including runtime and memory usage.

See [Data Resources](benchmark_resources_data.md) & [Jupyter Notebook](benchmark_resources_notebook.md) pages
