# Roadmap v2: Scope Expansion

We are actively developing the next version of the WGS QC Roadmap to include:

-  Support for Alternative reference genome assemblies to GRCh38 (in particular GRCh37/hg19 for backward compatibity with readily processed WGS data collections) 
-  Support for Long-read sequencing QC
-  Support Somatic variant QC
-  Addition of novel comunity-requested QC metrics 
-  Mapping of the controled vocabulary used across metrics' definition to existing ontology(ies)
-  Integration with GA4GH products like Data Connect and DaMaSC
