# WGS QC Standards Scope Statement

Despite growing efforts to share whole genome sequencing (WGS) data across research and clinical initiatives, the lack of standardised quality control (QC) definitions and methodologies remains a major barrier. WGS QC provides a structured set of formally defined quality control metrics and usage guidelines for short-read germline WGS data. These standards aim to establish a common foundation for quality assessment, enabling consistent reporting, improved interoperability, and greater confidence in WGS data integrity across initiatives.
