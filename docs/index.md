**Describes a set of quality control metrics and their detailed definitions to facilitate exchange of results across initiatives**

WGS Quality Control Standards describes a set of key quality control metrics and their detailed definitions that can be used as the basis for standardised guidelines for reporting quality control metrics for whole genome sequencing (WGS). Creating a common framework for QC of WGS results is needed to ensure that data generation adheres to published guidelines, and in turn, establishes confidence in the data quality and facilitates the exchange of results across initiatives.

For the initial round of this project, we propose to focus on QC of human WGS datasets (germline), generated with short-read technologies for research or clinical use.

**Roadmap v2: Expanding the Scope of WGS Quality Control Standards**

We are actively developing the next version of the WGS QC Roadmap to support:

-  Long-read sequencing QC
-  Somatic variant QC
-  Deeper metrics for short-read germline sequencing
-  Integration with GA4GH products like Data Connect and DaMaSC
