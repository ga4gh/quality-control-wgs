# Contributing
The additional information presented here are guidelines for issues, 
branches, commits, and pull requests. Suggested changes to this repo can be initiated as **Issues** or **Pull Requests** to allow for discussion and review. 

## Issues
[Issues](https://github.com/ga4gh/quality-control-wgs/issues) are for discussion of bug
reports, suggested changes and feature requests. Please refer to our [issue templates](https://github.com/ga4gh/quality-control-wgs/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) for guidance on what content to include in an issue. When creating an issue, use sentence case for the issue title and avoid the use of periods at the end of titles. Before posting a new issue, please check that your issue is not duplicative to an already open issue. 

Additional information about issues can be found at [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) in GitHub docs.

## Branches
[Branches](https://github.com/ga4gh/quality-control-wgs/branches) are used for
versioning and feature additions.  Feature branches must be associated with an
open issue describing the desired feature, and named after the issue as [issue number]-[short description].

More information can be found at [About branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) and [Managing branches](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches) in GitHub docs.

## Pull Requests
[Pull Requests](https://github.com/ga4gh/quality-control-wgs/pulls) (PRs) must be created for all new 
features and changes to the codebase and should target the `main` branch. Please refer to our [PR template](https://github.com/ga4gh/quality-control-wgs/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md) for guidance on what content to include in a PR. PR titles must reflect the issue associated with the PR.
Even those with write access to the main repository should in general create pull request branches within their own forks. This way when the main repository is forked again, the new fork is created with a minimum of extraneous volatile branches.

Additional information about PRs can be found at [Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) in GitHub docs.

## Approving Changes
Open issues and PRs are reviewed and triaged in our QC of WGS calls.
PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one Product Maintainer (TBD) before they are merged.

# Semantic Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)- this will determine if your proposed changes impact a major or minor release.
